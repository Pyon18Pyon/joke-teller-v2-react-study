# joke-teller-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [joke-teller-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/joke-teller-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is a joke teller. Click the **Tell Me A Joke** button, then it tells engineering related jokes.

## Key features

- Use an animated robot GIF from giphy.com for the background.
- Call a joke API and pass that to a text to speech API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
